            A string-keyed token-curated registry. This repo will track
            developments in the Token-Curated Registries paper series until 2.0
            TCRs. Originally developed for the AdChain project by ConsenSys
            interns working under my direction, this is now the canonical
            implementation of a generic token-curated registry, and is actively
            developed.

          <p>
            Partial-lock commit/reveal (PLCR) voting was originally described by
            the Colony project in 2016, but not implemented until 2017 by
            ConsenSys interns working under my direction. Most of the smart
            contract code and extremely high-quality data structures work was
            done by Yorke Rhodes and Cem Ozer. All I can really claim here are
            contributions to the test suite and deployment pipeline. Still, this
            is one of my proudest projects.

          <p>
            This is a simple fixed-price, finite-supply token sale originally
            developed for the AdChain token launch. It has since been forked by
            ConsenSys and adopted by projects like Grid+. I like this codebase a
            lot. In a way it is an artifact of a bygone era, but I actually
            still use this code all the time for small token sales.

            I became a maintainer of the ConsenSys tokens repo after doing an
            aggressive refactor for EIP-610 compliance at a time when the repo
            had been languishing. I've made contributions in the EVM code,
            deployment pipeline, and extensive contributions in the test suite.
            I published the tokens repo on EPM without really asking anybody and
            consequently became what is now one of two mnemonic holders.

            Data structures on Ethereum are extremely interesting to me because
            of how difficult it is to implement them. This repo composes the DLL
            and AttributeStore libraries from EPM into a sorted DLL.
