            Following the completion of the AdChain whitepaper, the authors began to discuss
            other potential applications of the system. In the weeks following we entertained
            several ideas that left us increasingly curious as to the system's complete
            potential. After discussing the AdChain paper in depth with Karl Floersch and
            discovering he had designed a very similar system (never implemented) for the Ujo
            project in September of 2016, the lightbulb went off as to the underlying system's
            genericity. At the urging of James Young, I wrote Token-Curated Registries 1.0.
            Token-curated registries are cryptosystems for decentrally curating lists, with
            intrinsic economic incentives for token holders to curate the list's contents
            judiciously.

            This very concise paper describes a generalized dispute resolution system backed by
            a token-curated registry. The system itself is quite nice, but it also contains an
            idea I find quite interesting: stake pools of undefined size that defer subjectivity
            regarding suitability to the user. Mark Beylin did most of the original thinking
            for this paper, but I like to think I was a useful sounding board for bouncing his
            ideas off of.
